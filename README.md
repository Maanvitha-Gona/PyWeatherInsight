# PyWeatherInsight  
**Weather Dataset Analysis with Python**  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to analyze a weather dataset (`weatherdata.csv`) and extract meaningful insights. Through various commands and functions in pandas.

- `head()`  
  - Displays the first N rows of the dataset (default is 5).  

- `shape`  
  - Provides the total number of rows and columns in the dataset.  

- `index`  
  - Shows the index of the dataframe.  

- `columns`  
  - Lists the column names of the dataset.  

- `info()`  
  - Provides a summary of the dataframe, including data types, non-null values, and memory usage.

### Data Characteristics  
- `dtypes`  
  - Displays the data type of each column.  

- `unique()`  
  - Lists all unique values in a specific column.  

- `nunique()`  
  - Shows the count of unique values in each column or a specific column.  

- `count`  
  - Provides the total number of non-null values for each column.  

- `value_counts()`  
  - Displays unique values in a column along with their frequency.
